DSA: Data Structures and Algorithms

A data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them ,and the functions or operations that
can be applied to the data.

Why we learn data structure:

- Finding shortest path, google map do- Graph
- Browser Navigation(Back and Forward) - linked list
- Stack: Undo Operations, Browser Back Functionality
- Queue: Key press sequence in keyboard
- Graph: Social Networking sites
- Tree: Folders in operating system

Alorithms:
Sequential steps for solving a problem


Q. Reverse a string without any inbuilt function of java

1. Naive Solution
2. Optimized Solution

Q. Leaders element in an array

1. Brute Force Approach - Naive Approach
2. Scan Array from Right - Optimized Approach
